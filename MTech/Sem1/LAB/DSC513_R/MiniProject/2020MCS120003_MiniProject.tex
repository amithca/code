\section{COVID - 19}\label{covid---19}}

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a
newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to
moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and
cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14
(estimated ranges vary from 2-10 days, 2-14 days, and 10-14 days),
during which the virus is contagious but the patient does not display
any symptom (asymptomatic transmission).
