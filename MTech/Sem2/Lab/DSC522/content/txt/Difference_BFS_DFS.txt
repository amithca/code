BFS finds the shortest path to the destination whereas DFS goes to the bottom of a subtree, then backtracks.
The full form of BFS is Breadth-First Search while the full form of DFS is Depth First Search.
BFS uses a queue to keep track of the next location to visit. whereas DFS uses a stack to keep track of the next location to visit.
BFS traverses according to tree level while DFS traverses according to tree depth.
BFS is implemented using FIFO list on the other hand DFS is implemented using LIFO list.
In BFS, you can never be trapped into finite loops whereas in DFS you can be trapped into infinite loops.
