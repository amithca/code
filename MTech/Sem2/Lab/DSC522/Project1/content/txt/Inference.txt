Memory requirements: 

The stack size is bound by the depth whereas the queue size is bound by the width. For a balanced binary tree with n nodes, that means the stack size would be log(n) but the queue size would b O(n). 

Speed:

 For a full search, both BFS and DFS visit all the nodes without significant extra overhead. If the search can be aborted when a matching element is found, BFS should typically be faster if the searched element is typically higher up in the search tree because it goes level by level. DFS might be faster if the searched element is typically relatively deep and finding one of many is sufficient.
