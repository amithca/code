Computational complexity is a field from computer science which analyzes algorithms based on the amount resources required for running it. The amount of required resources varies based on the input size, so the complexity is generally expressed as a function of n, where n is the size of the input.
It is important to note that when analyzing an algorithm we can consider the time complexity and space complexity. The space complexity is basically the amount of memory space required to solve a problem in relation to the input size. Even though the space complexity is important when analyzing an algorithm, in this story we will focus only on the time complexity.
